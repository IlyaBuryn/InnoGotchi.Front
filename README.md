# InnoGotchi.Front


This application is a web client for the [InnoGotchi.Back](https://github.com/IlyaBuryn/InnoGotchi.Back) application.

Both applications will work separately, but I advise you to also run the back-end solution when you launch the front-end part.

____

To run the application, you need to run the InnoGotchi.WEB project using:
* Visual Studio  
or 
* using the command line terminal
	* Navigate to the InnoGotchi.WEB/ directory in a terminal and then run `dotnet run`.
	* Then find in the terminal information about the running server on the local host in the form: https://localhost:7141 or https://localhost:5015
